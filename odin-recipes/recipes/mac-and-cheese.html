        <p> This is a simple mac and cheese that includes smoked salmon.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        <li>2 cups 1% milk
        <li>½ cups grated smoked fontina cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package fusilli pasta</li>
        <li>6 ounces cold-smoked Coho salmon, flaked</li>
        <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually pour in milk and continue to whisk until sauce is smooth and creamy. Simmer until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 cup fontina cheese, garlic salt, and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot. Add fusilli and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain. Return pasta to the pot and pour in bechamel sauce. Mix with a wooden spoon until pasta is completely coated with sauce. Gently stir in flaked salmon.</li>
        <li><p>Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish. Smooth out the top and sprinkle with remaining fontina cheese and panko.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown on top, about 25 minutes.</li>
